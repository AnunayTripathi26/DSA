# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my structured practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms** implemented in **Java**, organized by topic for easy navigation and revision.

The goal of this repository is to build a solid foundation in problem-solving using Java and prepare for technical interviews at product-based companies like **Amazon**, **Microsoft**, etc.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**
2. Navigate to `src/<topic_folder>/<file>.java`
3. Run the `main()` method inside each file

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions

- ✅ More categorized problems from **LeetCode**, **GFG**, and **Amazon SDE sheets**
- ✅ Proper file renaming for better searchability
- ✅ Time & space complexity in comments
- ✅ Optional unit tests for selected problems
